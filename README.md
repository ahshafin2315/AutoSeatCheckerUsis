# Class Availability Checker

This Python script checks for seat availability in real time for a specific course section from either the [BRAC University USIS](https://usis.bracu.ac.bd/academia/admissionRequirement/getAvailableSeatStatus) website or [Eniamza's Usis2Global](https://github.com/Eniamza/usis2global) and sends a notification to running device when seats are available. The script works on both desktop environments (Windows/Linux) and Android devices through the Termux terminal.

## Features
- Fetches real-time class schedule data from a JSON file.
- Checks seat availability for a specific course and section.

  - Desktop notification (Windows/Linux).
  - Termux notification (Android).

### Android (Termux)
  - [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) terminal installed.
  - Python installed in Termux (`pkg install python`).
  - [Termux-API](https://github.com/termux/termux-api) APK and Termux Package installed (`pkg install termux-api`).

cd AutoSeatCheckerUsis
```
or, just download the `usis_seatCheck.py` script and store in desired location

### 2. Install dependencies:

```
For all platforms (must):

```

### 3. Set Up & Run the Script
Run below code inside cloned script directory:

## Disclaimer 
Unfortunately, the usisdump of Eniamza has stopped updating due to data freeze in main USIS database or something (I donno :3). For now, the main USIS site seems to be most updated. So, sorry for the inconvenience if the script data won't update as expected ðŸ¥².
